Passage 1
There was once an ant that was very thirsty.	It ran here and there looking for some water but could not find any. Then suddenly, when the ant was almost ready to die of thirst, a large drop of water fell on it. The ant drank the water, which saved its life. The water was actually a tear from a young girl who was crying. Because of her sadness, the tear had magical qualities and suddenly the ant could speak the language of human beings.
	The ant looked up and saw the young girl sitting in front of a huge pile of seeds.
	"Why are you sad?" asked the ant.
	"I'm the prisoner of a giant." the girl told the ant. "He won't let me go until I've made three separate heaps of grain, barley（大麦）and rye（黑麦）out of this huge pile of seeds in which they are all mixed together."
	"That will take you a month!" the ant said, looking at the huge pile of seeds.
	"I know," the girl cried, "and if I haven't finished by tomorrow, the giant will eat me for his supper!"
	"Don't cry," the ant said, "my friends and I will help you."
	Soon thousands of ants were at work, separating the three kinds of seeds.
	The next morning, when the giant saw that the work had been done, he let the girl go. 
	Thus it was one of her tears that saved her life. 
1. The ant was playing when it ran here and there. 蚂蚁跑来跑去到处玩耍。
	A：T					B：F
2. The drop of water fell on the ant when it was nearly dying. 	
当蚂蚁快要死的时候，一滴水掉到它的身上。
	A：T					B：F
3. The young girl was crying because she wanted to have supper. 小女孩哭了因为她想吃饭。
	A：T					B：F
4. The giant would eat the girl if she failed to do the work. 如果女孩没有完成任务，巨人就会吃掉她。
	A：T					B：F
5. The ant's friends saved the girl's life. 蚂蚁的朋友救了小女孩的命。
	A：T					B：F
答案：BABAA
译文：从前有只蚂蚁口渴了。它到处找水但是一点水也没找到。就在蚂蚁快要渴死了的时候，一大滴水调到它身上。蚂蚁喝了这救命的水。这滴水其实是一个哭泣的小女孩的眼泪。由于她的悲伤，眼泪有了魔力，能让蚂蚁开口说人类的语言。
	蚂蚁抬起头来看见小女孩坐在一大堆种子面前。
	“你为什么伤心啊？”蚂蚁问道。
	“我是一个巨人的囚徒。”女孩告诉蚂蚁，“他让我把这大堆混在一起的种子分成谷物、大麦、黑麦三堆后才能走。”
	“那将需要一个月的时间。”蚂蚁看着那堆种子说道。
	“我知道。”女孩哭道：“但是如果我明天干不完的话，巨人将把我当晚餐吃掉。”
	“别哭了。”蚂蚁说到，“让我和我的朋友来帮助你吧。”
	不一会儿，上千的蚂蚁开始工作，把那堆种子分成了三堆。
	第二天一早，巨人看到一切都干完了，把女孩放回去了。
	这就是一滴她的眼泪救了她生命的故事。

 “Good,” said the doctor. “I shall not have to pay you anything.”

The government ordered everybody to kill rats. Most people were lazy, so they didn’t kill many. The government promised to pay some money for each dead rat. That made the people very happy.

Then workers were sent for and a big platform (台子) was made.
With the help of a worker, Thornhill started painting on the platform. They worked for a whole year and at last the pictures were ready.
Thornhill was happy when he looked at the pictures, for they were really beautiful. He looked at them for a long time, and then took one step back and looked again. Now the pictures were even more beautiful. He took another step, then another. Finally he was at the very edge of the platform, but he didn’t know it because he was thinking of his picture.
The worker saw everything. “What should I do?” he thought. “Thornhill was at the very edge of the platform. If I cry out, he will take another step, fall off it and surely be killed.” So the worker quickly took some paint (漆) and threw it at the pictures.

Passage 5
	Morgan Rees has always been a good businessman. He used to own three petrol stations and was busy most of the time. When he was 65, the normal retirement age, he decided that he didn’t want to stop, so he carried on working for another two years. Eventually, when he was nearly 68, his wife, Dolly, asked him to retire because she wanted to enjoy their old age together. Reluctantly, he handed over the business to his son.
But he was unhappy. He didn’t know what to do with himself. Although he read a lot of books and he went on holiday to interesting places with his wife, he was bored and began to get depressed because he hated being retired.
Then one day he saw an advertisement in the newspaper and, without telling his wife, he bought a small crockery (陶器) factory. The next week he told his family. They were horrified and worried. They thought he was too old at 71 to start work again. 
He is now 76 and he has expanded the company considerably. He has increased the number of staff from 6 to 24 and he has found many new customers for the products. He has developed the export market and has improved profits by 200%. He has opened a new design office and employed three young designers. They have been all over the world to get new ideas, and one of them has gone to France this week to a major trade fair. Most importantly, he hasn’t been bored since he bought the factory.

但是他并不高兴。他不知自己该怎么办。尽管他读了很多的书，而且也和妻子一起去一些好玩的地方去度假，但是他感到很无聊，并且由于讨厌退休而开始变得压抑沮丧。
在这之后的一天，他在报纸上看到了一则广告，也没有告诉他妻子，他就买下了一家小陶器厂。一周后他才告诉家里人。他们为此感到惊讶，而且有些担心。大家认为他不能以71岁高龄再重新开始工作了。
现在他76岁，已经显著地扩大了公司的规模。公司的员工人数从6人增加到24人，而且他还开发了很多新客户。他也开拓了出口市场，利润增长200%。他还开办了一家新的设计室，并且聘用了三名年轻人。他们一直世界各地四处发掘新的信息，其中的一位本周已经去了法国参加一次重大的商品交易会。最为重要的是，自从他收购了这家工厂后，他便不再感到没事可做。

Passage 6
 The residents of 24 Acacia Grove were dissatisfied with the condition of the property, so John Preston called a meeting to discuss things last week. At the meeting John suggested setting up a residents’ committee. Everyone was so worried and angry about the agent’s inactivity that they agreed, and they elected John as chairman of the committee. Many residents said that they were tired of telephoning the agent and tired of complaining about the flats. Although the agent was responsible for the flats, they thought that he didn’t do enough. Therefore John was asked to write to the agent and say that they were disappointed with the management of the flats.
The next service payment was due at the end of the month. However, they agreed not to pay it until they were happy with the plans to improve the property. They decided to tell the agent that he must start the work within one month. They all went away very pleased with themselves.

Passage 7
When I was a little girl, my brothers and I collected stamps for many years. My mother didn't use to work during the week, but she worked in the post office near our house on Saturdays, and she used to bring home all the new stamps as soon as they were issued(发行).
On the day of the World Cup football final in London in 1966, we were very excited because England were playing West Germany in the final. When we were having lunch, my mother told us to go to the post office straight away after the match if England won, but she didn't tell us why. At 2 o'clock my mother went back to work as usual, while the rest of the family were watching the football on TV at home. Although she wasn't watching the match, she was listening to it on the radio.
England won 4:2 and so my brothers and I ran to the post office. As we burst in, my mother was standing behind the counter. She was waiting to sell us a very special limited edition with ENGLAND WINNERS on each stamp. We were over the moon.
We still have it today, and perhaps it is worth a lot of money.
译文：当我还是个小女孩，我的兄弟和我收集邮票多年。我母亲通常周一至周五不工作，但周六在我们家附近的邮局上班。而且只要一发行最新的邮票，她就把它们都带回家。
1966年伦敦世界杯足球决赛那天，我们都非常兴奋，因为在决赛中英格兰队对阵西德队。吃午饭时，母亲告诉我们比赛后如果英格兰队赢就直接去邮局，但她没告诉我们原因。两点整母亲像往常一样去上班，而家里其他成员都在家收看比赛。虽然没有观看，但是她从收音机里收听了比赛。
英格兰队以4比2获胜，于是我和哥哥跑去邮局。当我们跑进去，母亲正站在柜台后面。她正等着卖给我们特别限量版邮票，每一枚都印着“英格兰胜利者”的字样。我们欣喜若狂。
我们直到今天还保存着它，或许现在它值很多钱了。

Passage 8
	When John and Victoria Falls arrived in New York City for one-year stay, they did not bring very many things with them. They had planned either to live in a furnished apartment or to buy used furniture. But they soon learned about a new system that more and more people are using. The renting of home furnishings (beds, tables, dishes, and so on) has become one of America’s fastest growing businesses.
What kinds of people rent their home furnishings instead of buying them? People who are international business or government officials, foreign students, airline workers, young married couple – people whose job or business may force them to move frequently from one city to another. They save a lot of trouble and the cost of moving their furniture each time. They simply rent new furniture when they reach their new homes. Young people with little money do not want to buy cheap furniture that they may soon dislike. They prefer to wait until they have enough money to buy furniture that they really like. Meanwhile, they find they can rent better quality furniture than they could afford to buy.
One family, who now has a large, beautiful home of their own, liked their rented furniture so much that they decided to keep renting it instead of buying new things. But usually people don’t like to tell others about it. The idea of renting home furnishings is still quite new, and they are not sure what their neighbors might think.
译文：当约翰和维多利亚・佛斯到达纽约开始他们的一年生活时，他们没有随身带很多东西。他们计划要么住在装修好的公寓里，要么买些旧家具。但是他们很快了解到越来越多的人正在采用的一种新的方式。租用家具（如床，桌子，盘子等）已经成为美国发展最快的行业之一。
什么样的人是租用家具而不是买家具的呢？从事国际商务的人，政府官员，外国学生，航空公司工作人员，刚结婚的年轻夫妇——那些由于工作而被迫频繁来往于不同城市的人。他们可以省去每次搬家具的麻烦和费用。他们到一个新家的时候，只需租新的家具就好了。收入少的年轻人不想买那些他们可能很快就不喜欢的便宜家具。他们宁愿等到有钱时买他们真正喜欢的家具。同时，他们发现他们租来的家具比他们买得起的家具质量更好。
有户人家，他们有自己的又大又漂亮的房子，可是他们太喜欢租来的家具了以至于他们决定继续租用而不是买新家具。但是人们通常不喜欢告诉别人这些。因为租家具的想法还是很新的，他们不能确定邻居们对此会怎么想。

Passage 9
	A characteristic of American culture that has become almost a tradition is to respect the self-made man — the man who has risen to the top through his own efforts, usually beginning by working with his hands. While the leader in business or industry or the college professor occupies a higher social position and commands greater respect in the community than the common laborer or even the skilled factory worker, he may take pains to point out that his father started life in America as a farmer or laborer of some sort.
This attitude toward manual labor is now still seen many aspects of American life. One is invited to dinner at a home that is not only comfortably but even luxuriously furnished and in which there is every evidence of the fact the family has been able to afford foreign travel, expensive hobbies, and college education for the children; yet the hostess probably will cook the dinner herself, will serve it herself and will wash dishes afterward, furthermore the dinner will not consist merely of something quickly and easily assembled from contents of various cans and a cake or a pie bought at the nearby bakery.
On the contrary, the hostess usually takes pride in careful preparation of special dishes. A professional may talk about washing the car, digging in his flowerbeds, painting the house. His wife may even help with these things, just as he often helps her with the dishwashing. The son who is away at college may wait on table and wash dishes for his living, or during the summer he may work with a construction gang on a highway in order to pay for his education.
译文：美国文化的一个特点，就是尊敬自我奋斗的人，这几乎已经成为美国的一项传统。这个人通常是白手起家，通过自己的努力到达社会顶峰。尽管公司、企业的领导，大学教授社会地位很高，在社会中获得比一般工人或技术人员更多的尊敬，他们也是想方设法指出自己的父亲在美国开始闯荡时也是一个农民或是某类工人。
这种对体力劳动的尊敬在美国生活的很多方面都能看到。一个人被邀请到一户家庭赴宴，这户家庭装潢舒适，甚至可以说是豪华，家中处处可以证明这家人支付得起国外旅行，奢侈的爱好和孩子的大学教育。但是这样的女主人很有可能自己做饭招待客人，然后洗刷餐具，并且这样的宴会不会仅仅是提供快餐式的罐头食品，从附近面包房买的蛋糕或馅饼。相反，女主人通常会精心准备特色菜，并以此而感到自豪。男主人会谈论自己如何洗车，在花园劳作，粉刷房子，他的太太也会来帮他做这些事就如同他会帮太太洗碗一样。他们的儿子在外地上大学，做餐厅侍应生，洗盘子来挣自己的生活费，有时候，在暑假的时候他会和建筑队一起在高速公路工作以赚取学费。
1. From paragraph 1, we know that in America _______.
从第一段我们可以知道在美国_______。
  A. people tend to have a high opinion of the self-made man人们对自我奋斗的人评价很高
  B. people can always rise to the top through their own efforts

Passage 10
	How men first learnt to invent words is unknown; in other words, the origin of language is a mystery. All we really know is that men, unlike animals, somehow invented certain sounds to express thought and feelings, actions and things, so that they could communicate with each other; and that later they agreed upon certain signs, called letters, which could be combined to present those sounds, and which could be written down. Those sounds, whether spoken or written in letters, we call words.
The power of words, then, lies in their associations—the thing they bring up before our minds. Words become filled with meaning for us by experience; and the longer we live, the more certain words recall to us the glad and sad events of our past; and the more we read and learn, the more the number of words that mean something increases. 	
Great writers are those who not only have great thoughts but also express these thoughts in words which appeal powerfully to our minds and emotions. This charming and telling use of words is what we call literary style. Above all, the real poet is a master of words. He can convey his meaning in words which sing like music and which by their position and association can move men to tears. We should therefore learn to choose our words carefully and use them accurately, or they will make our speech silly and vulgar.
译文：没有人知道人类最初是如何发明文字的。换句话说，语言的起源是个谜。我们所知道的就是：人，不同于动物，不知怎么发明了某些声音来表达思想、情感、行为和事物，以便彼此相互交流。后来他们统一了某些符号，就是我们所说的字母，这些字母可以结合起来呈现那些声音，从而可以把这些声音记录下来。那些声音---不管他们是口头上说的还是写在纸上的---我们称之为文字。
文字的力量在于其联系性——即文字在我们的头脑中可以代表那些事物。通过各种经历，文字对我们充满了含义。我们活得越长，能让我们回忆起过去的喜怒哀乐的文字就越多；我们阅读、学习的越多，对我们有意义的文字量就越大。
伟大的作家不仅具有伟大的思想而且擅长用文字来表达这些思想。他们的文字强烈地震撼、吸引着我们的心灵和情感。文字各种魅力的、生动的使用方法就是我们所说的文学体裁。真正的诗人首先是文字大师。他可以用押韵的音乐般的词汇来表达自己的思想，并通过文字位置的转换及其联想性让人感动得热泪盈眶。因此，我们应该学会仔细选择我们的文字并准确使用文字，否则我们说出来的话就会可笑而又粗俗。
1. The origin of language is _______.  语言的起源是：___________.
  A. a legend handed down from the past	B. a matter that is hidden or secret
  C. a question difficult to answer		    D. a problem not yet solved一个还未解决的问题
2. What is true about words?      关于词汇哪一项是对的？
  A. They are used to express feelings only.		    B. They can not be written down.
  C. They are simply sounds.他们是简单的声音	D. They are mysterious.
3. The real power of words lies in their _______.  文字的真正力量在于其____
  A. properties							B. characteristics		
C. peculiarity							D. representative function  代表功能  
4. By “association”, the author means _______.  作者用“联系性”这个词指

B. a joining of ideas in the mind头脑中思想的联接
  C. an appearance which is puzzling	
D. a strange feature

B. He can convey his ideas in words which sing like music.
  C. He can move men to tears.				
D. His style is always charming.

Passage 11
	Shyness is the cause of much unhappiness for a great many people. Shy people are anxious and self-conscious; that is, they are excessively concerned with their own appearance and actions. Worrisome thoughts are constantly occurring in their minds: what kind of impression am I making? Do they like me? Do I sound stupid? Am I wearing unattractive clothes?
It is obvious that such uncomfortable feelings must negatively affect people. A person’s conception of himself or herself is reflected in the way he or she behaves, and the way a person behaves affects other people’s reactions. In general, the way people think about themselves has a profound effect on all areas of their lives.
Shy people, having low self-esteem, are likely to be passive and easily influenced by others. They need reassurance that they are doing “the right thing.” Shy people are very sensitive to criticism; they feel it confirms their feelings of inferiority. They also find it difficult to be pleased by compliment with a statement like this one, “You’re just saying that to make me feel good. I know it’s not true.” It is clear that while self-awareness is a healthy quality, overdoing it is harmful.
Can shyness be completely eliminated, or at least reduced? Fortunately, people can overcome shyness with determined and patient efforts in building self-confidence. Since shyness goes hand in hand with a lack of self-esteems, it is important for people to accept their weakness as well as their strengths.
Each one of us is a unique, worthwhile individual, interested in our own personal ways. The better we understand ourselves, the easier it becomes to live up to our full potential. Let’s not allow shyness to block our chances for a rich and fulfilling life.
译文：羞怯是许多人不快乐的原因。害羞的人焦虑不安，自我意识强，也就是说，他们过分在意自己的形象和行为。脑海中不断盘旋着一些使自己不安的想法：我给人留下了什么印象?他们喜欢我吗?我讲话是不是傻里傻气?我穿的衣服毫不引人注目？
显而易见，这种不安的感觉必然对人产生不利的影响。一个人的自我看法反映在他或她的行为上，而一个人的行为方式又会影响他人的反应。通常，人们如何看待自己对他们生活的各个方面都会产生深刻的影响。
     羞怯的人非常自卑，往往消极被动，容易受他人的影响。他们（是否）在做“该做的事情”需要得到别人的肯定。羞怯的人对批评很敏感，他们认为批评正好证实了他们比别人差。他们发现自己很难因为受到表扬而高兴，因为他们总是这么说：“你这么说是为了让我感觉好一些。我知道那不是真的。”显然，尽管自我意识是一种健康的品质，过分就有害了。
  能否彻底消除或是减轻羞怯感呢？幸运的是，人们可以通过坚持不懈的努力建立自信，从而克服羞怯。由于羞怯与缺少自尊是密切相关的，那么正视自己的弱点和正视自己的优点一样重要。
	 我们每个人都是独一无二、有价值的个体。我们自有吸引人的地方。我们对自己了解越多，就越容易充分发挥自己的潜能。不要让羞怯成为妨碍我们拥有丰富和成功生活的绊脚石。
1. What does the author try to prove by citing “what kind of impression am I making?”
  作者通过引用“我给人留下了什么印象?”来试图说明什么？
  A. Shy people benefit from their caring about their appearance.

3. That shy people react to a compliment in such a way is _________.
害羞的人以这种方式对待赞扬的方法是_______。

Passage 12
	In the United States, it is not customary to telephone someone very early in the morning. If you telephone him early in the day, while he is shaving or having breakfast, the time of the call shows that the matter is very important and requires immediate attention. The same meaning is attached to telephone calls made after 11:00 p.m. If someone receives a call during sleeping hours, he assumes it’s a matter of life or death. The time chosen for the call communicates its importance. In social life, time plays a very important part. In the U.S.A. guests tend to feel they are not highly regarded if the invitation to a dinner party is extended only three or four days before the party date. But it is not true in all countries. In other areas of the world, it may be considered foolish to make an appointment too far in advance because plans which are made for a date more than a week away tend to be forgotten. The meaning of time differs in different parts of the world. Thus, misunderstandings arise between people from different cultures that treat time differently. Promptness is valued highly in American life, for example. If people are not prompt, they may be regarded as impolite or not fully responsible. In the U.S. no one would think of keeping a business associate waiting for an hour, it would be too impolite. A person who is 5 minutes late, will say a few words of explanation, though perhaps he will not complete the sentence.
译文：在美国，一般不习惯每天很早打电话给某个人。如果你很早打电话给他，在他刮胡子或吃早饭的时候，那就说明这件事情非常重要，需要立刻处理。晚上十一点以后打电话也是同样的意思。如果一个人在睡觉的时候接到电话，那他肯定觉得这是一件生死攸关的大事。选择打电话的时间表达了事情的重要程度。在社交生活中，时间是起着非常重要的作用。在美国，如果在宴会三四天前才受到邀请，那受邀者就会认为自己不是很受重视。但并不是在所有的国家都如此。在世界上的其它地方，提前很长时间来预约被认为是很愚蠢的，因为提前一个星期预约的事情很容易被忘记。所以时间的含义在不同的地方是不一样的。因此，来自时间文化不同背景的人之间就会产生误会。例如，准时在美国社会是受到高度认可的。如果你不准时，就会被认为不礼貌或不够负责任。在美国，没有一个人会让一个商务伙伴等待一小时，这样做太不礼貌了。一个人如果迟到五分钟，就要做出解释，尽管他可能还没说完，大家就原谅他了。

B. The role of time in social life over the world. 世界各地时间在社会生活中扮演的角色。

Passage 13
	There are three kinds of goals: short-term, medium-range and long-term goals.
	Short-term goals are those that usually deal with current activities, which we can apply on a daily basis. Such goals can be achieved in a week or less, or two weeks, or possibly, months. It should be remembered that just as a building is no stronger than its foundation, long-term goals cannot amount to very much without the achievement of solid short-term goals. Upon completing our short-term goals, we should date the occasion and then add new short-term goals that will build on those that have been completed.
	The intermediate goals build on the foundation of the short-term goals. They might deal with just one term of school or the entire school year, or they could even extend for several years. Any time you move a step at a time, you should never allow yourself to become discouraged or overwhelmed. As you complete each step, you will enforce the belief in your ability to grow and succeed. And as your list of completion dates grow, your motivation and desire will increase.
	Long-term goals may be related to our dreams of the future. They might cover five years or more. Life is not a static thing. We should never allow a long-term goal to limit us or our course of action.
译文：目标有三种：短期目标，中期目标和长期目标。
短期目标通常是指以每天为基础，处理当前任务的目标。短期目标可以在一星期左右，两星期，或者几个月内完成。我们必须记住，正如只有地基牢靠，建筑物才坚固一样，长期目标如果脱离了扎实的短期目标的实现是不可能实现的。我们一完成短期目标，应该记下完成日期，然后在已完成的短期目标的基础上添加新的短期目标。
中期目标是建立在短期目标的基础上。可以在一个学期或一个学年内完成，或者延长至几年完成。每次你向目标前进了一步，都不要让自己感到没有信心或者压力重重。你每完成一个目标，就会增加成功的信心。并且随着你完成目标的日期越来越近，你对成功的动机和渴望就越强烈。
长期目标是与我们未来的梦想有关的。通常都是在五年内或更长的时间内完成。但是生活不是一成不变的。我们不能让长期目标限制我们或我们的行为。
1. 	Our long-term goals mean a lot ____________.
    如果我们能完成各个短期目标，那么我们的长期目标将意义深远。
A. If we cannot reach solid short-term goals		B. If we complete the short-term goals
C. If we have dreams of the future				D. If we put forward some plans
2. 	New short-term goals are built upon _______. 短期目标是以以前完成的目标为前提的。
A. a daily basis							B. your achievement in a week
C. current activities							D. the goals that have been completed
3. 	When we complete each step of our goals, ____________.
每完成一个目标，将会增加我们成功的信心。
A. we will win final success					
B. we are overwhelmed
C. we will build up our confidence to achieve success
D. we should have strong desire for setting new goals
4. 	What is the main idea of this passage? 这篇短文的中心思想是什么？
A Life is a dynamic thing.				
B. we should set up long-term goals
C. Different kinds of goals in life.	目标的不同种类。
D. The limitation of long-term goals.
5. 	Which of the following statements is wrong according to the passage? ____________
    根据短文，下面哪种说法是错误的？
A. The long-term goals cannot amount to very much without the achievement of solid short-term goals
B. The intermediate goals build on the foundation of the short-term goals.
C. Life is a static thing, thus we should never allow a long-term goal to limit us or our course of action.  生活是一成不变的，所以我们不能让长期目标制约我们的生活和我们的行为。
D. We should often add new short-term goals to those which have been completed.

Passage 14
	What makes a person a scientist?	Does he have ways or tools of learning that are different from those of others? The answer is “no”. It is not the tools a scientist uses but how he uses these tools that make him a scientist. You will probably agree that knowing how to use a power is important to a carpenter. You will probably agree, too, that knowing how to investigate, how to discover information, is important to everyone. The scientist, however, goes one step further, he must be sure that he has a reasonable answer to his questions and that his answer can be confirmed by other persons. He also works to fit the answer he gets to many questions into a large set of ideas about how the world works.
The scientist’s knowledge must be exact. There is no room for half right or right just half the time. He must be as nearly right as the conditions permit. What works under one set of conditions at one time must work under the same conditions at other times. If the conditions are different, any changes the scientist observes in a demonstration must be explained by the changes in the conditions. This is one reason that investigations are important in science. Albert Einstein, who developed the theory of relativity, arrived at this theory through mathematics. The accuracy of this mathematics was later tested through investigations, Einstein’s ideas were shown to be correct. A scientist uses many tools for measurements. Then the measurements are used to make mathematical calculations that may test his investigations.
译文：是什么使一个普通人成为科学家？他有与众不同的学习方法和工具吗？答案是否定的。不是因为科学家使用的工具，而是因为他使用工具的方法使得他成为科学家。你也许认同怎么用力对一名木匠来说很重要。你也许也认同如何研究调查，如何发现信息对每个人来说都很重要。然而，科学家比这更进一步，他必须确定对自己的问题给出了一个合理的答案，并且他的答案通过别人也可以得到证实。同时，他还要让自己得出的许多答案符合关于世界如何运作的理论之中。
	科学家的知识必须是精确的。不能出现半对半错或者只对一半的情况。他必须在条件允许的情况下尽可能正确。在某个时间某个条件下成立的理论或公式必须在其他时间相同的条件下都能成立。如果条件发生了变化，科学家在证明过程中观察到的任何变化都必须由条件的变化来解释。这就是调查在科学研究中十分重要的一个理由。爱因斯坦通过数学方法提出了相对论。其数学方法的正确性被后人的调查研究所证实，从而证明该理论是正确的。一个科学家会用很多方法来进行调查研究。然后用数学来计算这些结果，从而测试这些调查结果是否正确。
1. What makes a scientist according to the passage? 
根据这篇文章的观点科学家是如何来的？
  A. The tools he uses.				B. The way he uses his tools. 他使用工具的方法
  C. His way of learning.			D. The various tools he uses.
2. “The scientist, however, goes one step further…”. The author says this to show _______.
   “然而，科学家比这更进一步……”作者这么说是为了说明什么？
  A. the importance of information			
B. the importance of thinking
  C. the difference between scientists and ordinary people科学家与普通人的区别
  D. the difference between carpenters and people with other jobs
3. A sound scientific theory should be one that _______.
一项伟大的科学理论应该是怎么样的？
A. works not only under one set of conditions at one time, but also under the same conditions at other times 不仅只在一种条件下一次可行，而是要在同样的条件下一直可行。
  B. does not allow any changes even under different conditions
  C. can be used for many purposes
  D. leave no room for improvement
4. The author quotes the case of Albert Einstein to illustrate _______.
作者引用爱因斯坦的例子是为了证明什么？
  A. that measurements are keys to success in science
  B. that accuracy of mathematics
  C. that the investigations are important in science调查研究在科学领域十分重要。
  D. that the mathematical calculations may test his investigations
5. What is the main idea of the passage? 这篇文章的中心意思是什么？
  A. The theory of relativity.					
B. Exactness is the core of science.
  C. Scientists are different from ordinary people.

  确切性和使用工具的方法是成为科学家的重要因素。

Passage 15
Many people who work in London prefer to live outside it, and to go in to their offices or schools every day by train, car or bus, even though this means they have to get up early in the morning and reach home late in the evening.
One advantage of living outside London is that houses are cheaper. Even a small flat in London without a garden costs quite a lot to rent. With the same money, one can get a little house in the country with a garden of one’s own.
Then, in the country one can really get away from the noise and hurry of busy working lives. Even though one has to get up earlier and spend more time in trains or buses, one can sleep better at night and during weekends and on summer evenings, one can enjoy the fresh, clean air of the country. If one likes gardens, one can spend one’s free time digging, planting, watering and doing the hundred and one other jobs which are needed in a garden. Then, when the flowers and vegetables come up, one has got the reward together with those who have shared the secret of Nature.
	Some people, however, take no interest in country things: for them, happiness lies in the town, with its cinemas and theatres, beautiful shops and busy streets, dance-halls and restaurants. Such people would feel that their life was not worth living if they had to live it outside London. An occasional walk in one of the parks and a fortnight’s (two weeks) visit to the sea every summer is all the country they want: the rest they are quite prepared to leave to those who are glad to get away from London every night.
译文：很多在伦敦工作的人喜欢住在伦敦郊外，喜欢每天乘火车、汽车或公交车去上班或上学。尽管这意味着他们不得不早出晚归。
住在伦敦郊外的一个好处就是房子便宜。在伦敦即使是没有花园的小公寓也需要一笔不菲的租金，而用同样的钱，你可以在郊区买一个带花园的小房子了。
然后，在乡村你可以远离喧嚣、忙碌的工作生活。尽管你不得不早起，花很多的时间来乘火车或公交车，但是你可以在晚上睡得更好。在周末和夏季的夜晚，你可以享受乡村清新干净的空气。如果你喜欢花园，你可以在花园里干一些像挖土、种植、浇水等许多园艺活。然后当鲜花和蔬菜生长起来的时候，你就与其他分享大自然秘密的人们一起得到了奖赏。
但是，有些人对乡村并不感兴趣。对他们来说，幸福就在市区里，那里有电影院、剧院、漂亮的商店、繁忙的街道、舞厅和饭店。如果必须得住在伦敦郊外的话，这些人就觉得生活没有任何意义。（对于那些热爱都市生活的人来说）他们所需要的乡村生活，就是偶尔去公园散步，每个夏天去海边过上两个星期。其他跟乡村有关的东西，就让那些每天晚上都急于离开伦敦的人们（住在郊外的人们）去享受吧。
1. Which of the following statements is NOT true? 下列哪个陈述是不对的？
  A. People who love Nature prefer to live outside the city.
B. People who work in London prefer to live in the country. 
在伦敦工作的人都喜欢住在伦敦市郊
  C. Some people enjoying city life prefer to work and live inside London.
  D. Many nature lovers, though working in London, prefer to live outside the city.
2. With the same money needed for _______, one can buy a little house with a garden in the country.
   用同样的钱_______,他可以在乡村买到一套有花园的小房子。
  A. getting a small flat with a garden			
B. having a small flat with a garden
C. renting a small flat without a garden	租一套没有花园的小公寓	
D. buying a small flat without a garden	
3. When the garden is in blossom, the one _______ has been rewarded.
   当花园里开满鲜花的时候，那个_______的人就得到了奖赏。
  A. living in the country				
B. having spent time working in the garden花时间在花园里工作
  C. having a garden of his own			D. having been digging, planting and watering
4. People who think happiness lies in the city life would feel that _______ if they had to live outside London.	
那些认为幸福就在城市里人会感到_______如果他们不得不住在郊外。
  A. their life was meaningless	他们的生活毫无意义	B. their life was invaluable 
  C. they didn’t deserve a happy life			        D. they were not worthy of their happy life
5. The underlined phrase get away from in the 3rd paragraph refers to _______.
  在第3段中，划线的词组get away from指_______。
  A. deal with								B. do away with 
C. escape from	逃脱某个地方			D. prevent from 

Passage 16
The United States covers a large part of the North American continent. Its neighbors are Canada to the north and Mexico to the south. Although the United States is a big country, it is not the largest in the world. In 2000, its population was over 222 million.
When this land first became a nation, after winning its independence from England, it had thirteen states. Each of the states was represented on the American flag by a star. All these states were in the eastern part of the continent. As the nation grew toward the west, new states were added and new stars appeared on the flag. For a long time, there were 48 stars. In 1959, however, two more stars were added to the flag, representing the new states of Alaska and Hawaii.
Indians were the first people of the land which is now the United States. There are still many thousands of Indians now living in all parts of the country. Sometimes it is said that the Indians are “the only real Americans”. Most Americans come from all over the world. Those who first come in greatest numbers to make their homes on the eastern coast of North America were mostly from England. It is for that reason that the language of the United States is English and that its culture and customs are more like those of England than those of any other country in the world.
译文：
美国占北美大陆很大一部分土地。它北邻加拿大，南接墨西哥。虽然美国是一个大国，但它不是世界上最大的。在2000年，它的人口超过2.22亿。
这片土地刚从英国独立出来，第一次成为一个国家的时候，只有十三个州，每个周在美国国旗上由一颗星来代表。这些州都在东部。当这个国家不断向西扩大，就增加了新的州，同时它们也出现在国旗上。很长一段时间，美国有48个州，可是，到1959年，国旗上又多了两颗星，分别代表阿拉斯加和夏威夷。
印第安人是如今叫做美国的这块土地上的最初居民。现在在全国各地仍然居住着许多这些原始居民的后裔。有时人们说印第安人才是“真正的美国人”。不过，大部分美国人是来自世界各地。那些最早大批来到北美东海岸建立家园的人大部分来自英格兰，也是由于这个原因，美国的国语为英语，而它的文化习俗也与英国的更为相像。

   A. America is the largest country in the world.
   B. The United States lies next to Canada and Mexico.
     美国临近加拿大和墨西哥。
   C. America covers most part of the North American continent.

   B. fifty; 1959       直到1959年，美国才有50颗星。
   C. fifty; this land first became a nation
   D. fifty; 1964
4. Why is English the language of America?为什么美国的国语为英语？
   A. Because English is the native language of the Indians.
   B. Because most Americans come from all over the world.
   C. Because Canada is America’s nearest neighbor.
   D. Because most of the people who first settled in America were from England.
   因为最早大批来美国定居的人来自英格兰。
5. The title for the passage is “__________”.这篇文章最好的题目是________。
   A. The States of America
   B. The language of America

译文：昨天晚上，一场大火袭击了安在曼彻斯特的房子。
半夜里房间起火的时候，安的父母刚好出城过周末了。小狗丹尼在后花园中大声吠叫，把安吵醒了。安闻到着火的味道。她立刻起床穿过满是烟雾的房子去叫醒她的哥哥，弗兰克。
弗兰克醒不过来，这时安得到了狗的帮助。弗兰克没有意识的身体对于这个小女孩来说太重，因此她一个人没办法挪动哥哥的身体，但是这个聪明的女孩把狗带了进来，并把牵狗的皮带绑到弗兰克的左脚踝上，自己拉住哥哥的右脚踝，在狗的帮助下把弗兰克挪到了安全的地方。
安，这个10岁的女孩，救了自己的哥哥。

小贴士：
如果选项中有首字母大写的词，比如本篇文章中的A选项，要首先考虑这个词要放在句首。所以，不用读文章就能确定这里第2题选A，其他的空就可以选另外的选项了，这样至少能猜对两个呢！
对于基础好的同学，这个题并不难。根据词义和词性联系上下文即可作对。考前两周左右会补充完形填空练习题，有精力的同学可以练习掌握做题技巧。
本部分分值占15分，比例较大，所以基础好的同学一定要认真做。

本题型一定要看视频讲解，可以做到不看题，直接就能蒙对答案！！
